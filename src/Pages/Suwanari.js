      <h1>Suwanari Project by MOH Sri Lanka</h1>
      <p>
        The Suwanari Project is a health initiative conducted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Sri Lanka, aimed at promoting the well-being of women aged 35 and above. This program is a weekly health camp held at all MOH offices every Tuesday. The primary focus is on early detection and prevention of various health conditions through comprehensive health screenings. The key components of the Suwanari Project include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PAP Tests:</strong> To screen for cervical cancer and other potential abnormalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Diabetes Tests:</strong> To check blood sugar levels and diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes.</li>
        <li><strong>Blood Pressure Tests:</strong> To monitor and manage blood pressure, helping to prevent hypertension and related complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Overall Health Assessments:</strong> Including general check-ups and consultations to address other health concerns and provide relevant medical advice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By providing these essential health services, the Suwanari Project aims to enhance the quality of life for women over 35, encouraging regular health check-ups and fostering a proactive approach to health management. This initiative reflects the commitment of the MOH Sri Lanka to ensure accessible and preventive healthcare for all women, contributing significantly to the overall public health landscape in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project's consistent weekly schedule ensures that women can regularly monitor their health and receive timely interventions, thereby reducing the risk of serious health issues and promoting long-term health and well-being.
